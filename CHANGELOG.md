# Version 1.1.1

## Released 11-17-2014

This release fixes a bug where multi-word statuses were not accounted for and so clicking a pill button for a multi-word status would not actually select the status. And a multi-word status would also not use the text color assigned to it if using that option.

I also took the opportunity to increase the efficiency of the Javascript by eliminating a DOM traversal for every click.

- Fixed a bug where multi-word statuses would not work

If, like me, you are tired of clicking multiple times to get the status set right when publishing an ExpressionEngine entry and you just want to see the status you want, aim your mouse at it and just click once, then this add-on is for you. It’s super easy to install and will work on all your channel entries.
