# Pillster 1.1.1 for ExpressionEngine

Turn the ExpressionEngine status dropdown into pill buttons for a more friendly user experience.

If, like me, you are tired of clicking multiple times to get the status set right when publishing an ExpressionEngine entry and you just want to see the status you want, aim your mouse at it and just click once, then this add-on is for you. It's super easy to install and will work on all your channel entries.

## Install

Simply copy the `pillster` directory to your ExpressionEngine third_party directory and install the extension in the ExpressionEngine Control Panel. Your status dropdowns will now appear as clickable pill buttons, saving you clicks and exposing all the statuses for you to see.

## Update

To update from previous versions the old fashioned way, replace the `pillster` directory in your ExpressionEngine `third_party` directory with the latest version and visit the `Extensions` page of your ExpressionEngine Control Panel.

The zip download from Github is also [DevDemon Updater] compatible. Drag and drop and you're all set.

## Settings

There is currently one setting that lets you use your status colors as the text color for the pill buttons.
