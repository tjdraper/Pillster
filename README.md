# Pillster 2.0.1 for ExpressionEngine 3

The name Pillster comes from the fact that it used to turn the status dropdown into pill buttons. Now it uses ExpressionEngine 3’s native radio button styles, but they’re still kind of like pills and changing the name is too much trouble. And what would I change the name to anyway?

So, Pillster turns the ExpressionEngine status dropdown into radio buttons which makes a little more sense to me. It allows visually scanning all avaialble statuses and once, and simply clicking on the one you want.
